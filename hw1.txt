## Using  chipotle.tsv  in the  data  subdirectory:
Used __git clone__ to clone dat9 onto computer and access data subfoler

## Look at the head and the tail, and think for a minute about how the data is structured.
_head chipotle.tsv_
Data is structured as purchase order for food items.

## What do you think each column means?
Each column represents a description (label) of the attribute to be recorded. e.g. item name, unit price etc.

## What do you think each row means? 
Each row contains the value of the attribute for a specific order e.g. Quantity ordered, unit price of item

## How many orders do there appear to be?
_tail chipotle.tsv_
The last order number in the file is listed as __1834__.

## How many lines are in the file?
_wc -l chipotle.tsv_
This command returns a value of __4623__ lines


## Which burrito is more popular, steak or chicken?
_grep -i chicken chipotle.tsv > chicken.tsv_
_wc -l chicken.tsv_
__1565__ chicken.tsv

_grep -i steak chipotle.tsv > beef.tsv_
_wc -l beef.tsv_
__706__ beef.tsv

Hence __Chicken__ is more popular

## Do chicken burritos more often have black beans or pinto beans?
_grep -i black chicken.tsv > black.tsv_
_wc -l black.tsv_
__759__ black.tsv

_grep -i pinto chicken.tsv > pinto.tsv_
_wc -l pinto.ts_
__265__ pinto.tsv

Hence chicken burritos most often have __black beans__
